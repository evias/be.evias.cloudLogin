		<h3 class="alt" id="features"><strong>A) Features</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This App is prepared for any Java developer to start with a fully functioning and
		intuitive Parse.com API implementation for the Android platform. The principal feature
		of this application is to provide a way to store Accounts linked to a Parse.com App's Account.</p>

		<h5>Who needs this App ?</h5>
		<p>Any developer who wants to skip the development of the User Area for Android Apps developed
		 in Java. The cloudLogin App can be modified very easily and uses of-the-doc Java practices
		 so any Android developer following Google Android's documentation guidelines will be able to
		 understand and modify this application according to his/her needs.</p>

		<h5>Why is this App useful ?</h5>
		<p>The cloudLogin App comes with a functioning UI with Navigation, Login and Subscribe features.
		 Developers can adapt it very easily to their own needs and start building App specific features
		 needed for their App. The features provided in cloudLogin are meant to be extended and are very
		 easily customizable. More details about how to extend the App to your own needs can be found in
		 the <a href="#">Architecture</a> section.</p>

		<h5>What concrete Features are available ?</h5>
		<p>The application provides an intuitive Fragment pages implementation which can be adapted to any
		 needs and provides Android system integrations. This implementation is useful because it saves
		 you the time to provide with different implementations of your Features for Integration in other
		 Android applications. In fact, Android SDK's Fragments can be integrated and displayed from any other
		 Android SDK's Activity.</p>

		<p>Other features implemented are related to the Parse.com API and are used to mimic a Subscribe
		 and Login workflow implementation. The Parse.com API provides with a REST API which allows us
		 to store the Users of the application. The cloudLogin API implementation provides a very easy
		 to extend Interface called "AuthenticationInterface". See the <a href="#">Architecture</a> section
		 for more details.</p>

		<h3 class="alt" id="architecture"><strong>B) Architecture</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h5>App Architecture</h5>
		<p>The AndroidManifest.xml file registers the <b>cloudLoginRunPointActivity</b> class as the MAIN
		 action Intent of the cloudLogin Android App. This class determines if a user must authenticate
		 (displayAccountPicker) or if an active account token is available (displayNavigationDrawer).</p>
		<p>When someone logs in to your application, <b>cloudLoginMainActivity</b> is started and decides
		 which Fragment page must be displayed. This class also determines wether the Navigation Drawer
		 must be opened or closed.</p>
		<p>The class <b>cloudLoginPageFragment</b> implements the <i>Factory design pattern</i> and provides
		 with an intuitive way of creating and displaying Fragment pages. (Which can then be integrated in
		 other Android applications)</p>

		<h5>Business Layer Architecture</h5>
		<p>Data in the cloudLogin app is stored on Parse.com but this can be very easily changed by implementing
		 the AuthenticationInterface in your own class. You can then user whatever API you want for Login and
		 Subscription.</p>
		<p>An example <b>ServiceBase</b> class is provided which defines a "ping" feature. This feature is then
		 used to determine wether the application is currently used Online or Offline. This class can be extended
		 to provide with more detailed business layer features such as user account updates through a HTTP POST
		 request etc. The <b>ServiceBase</b> class implements a simple HTTP/JSON API call to my own website.</p>

		<p>Once again, thank you very much for purchasing this App. I'd be glad to help you if you have
		any questions relating to this App. No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have
		a more general question relating to development on CodeCanyon, you might consider visiting the
		forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.</p>
